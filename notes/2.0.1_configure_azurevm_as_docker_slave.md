## (2) Configure Azure VM as Docker slave

###### Refernce: https://devopscube.com/docker-containers-as-build-slaves-jenkins/

- install jenkins on windows as per notes/1.0.0_install_jenkins_windows.md

- add necessary firewall rules for your VM to accept connection on port 4243

![add inbound rule for port in azure](images/2.0.4_add_rule_for_port_in_azure.jpg)

- Open Remote docker API connection as per following: https://scriptcrunch.com/enable-docker-remote-api/
- open following file: /lib/systemd/system/docker.service and modify following line:

```
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H tcp://0.0.0.0:4243 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock
```

- restart Docker service

```

- Test from windows machine if remote Docker API connection is working: curl http://52.150.19.84:4243/version

```

- Test remote Docker API connection using REST client:

```
curl --location --request GET 'http://52.150.19.84:4243/images/json'
```

- OR using POSTMAN as follows: 

![Docker API access using REST client](images/2.0.5_Docker_API_postman_REST_access.jpg)

- Next we will configure Jenkins to use this Docker agent
- Step 1: Head over to Jenkins Dashboard –> Manage Jenkins –> Manage Plugins.

- Step 2: Under the Available tab, search for “Docker” and install the docker cloud plugin and restart Jenkins. Here is the official plugin site. Make
  sure you install the right plugin as shown below

![Install Docker Plugin for Jenkins](images/2.0.6_Jenkins_Docker_Plugin.jpg)

![Install Docker Plugin for Jenkins](images/2.0.6_Jenkins_Docker_Plugin_install.jpg)

- Step 3: Once installed, head over to Jenkins Dashboard –> Manage Jenkins –>Configure system : http://localhost:8080/configureClouds/

- Step 4: Under “Configure System”, if you scroll down, there will be a section named “cloud” at the last. There you can fill out the docker host
  parameters for spinning up the slaves.

- Step 5: Under docker, you need to fill out the details as shown in the image below.

Note: Replace “Docker URI” with your docker host IP. For example, tcp://52.150.19.84:4243 You can use the “Test connection” to test if Jenkins is able to connect to the Docker host.

![Docker Configuration in Jenkins](images/2.0.7_Docker_configuration_in_Jenkins.jpg)


- Build Docker image and run container using notes/2.0.2_create_Jenkins_docker_Container.md.  
  
- Alternatively can use bibinwilson/jenkins-slave:latest ( password is jenkins/jenkins)

![Jenkins Docker image credentials](images/2.0.8_Jenkins_Docker_image_credentials_added.jpg)


- Step 6: Now, from “Docker Agent Template” dropdown, click the “Add Docker template” and fill in the details based on the explanation and the image given below and save the configuration.

1. Labels – Identification for the docker host. It will be used in the Job configuration. Here we usejava-docker-slave
1. Name: Name of the docker template. Here we use the same name as label ie, java-docker-slave
1. Docker Image –bibinwilson/jenkins-slave:latest or the image that you created for the slave.
1. Remote Filing System Root – Home folder for the user you have created. In our case, it’s /home/jenkins
1. Credentials – click add and enter the SSH username and password that you have created for the docker image. Leave the rest of the configuration as shown in the image below and click save. If you are using my Docker image, the user will be jenkins & password is also jenkins.: 


![Configure Docker Template](images/2.0.9_Configure_Docker_template.jpg)


- By default, the workspace will not be persisted in the host. However, if you want the workspace to be persistent, add a host volume path under container settings.

- For example, if you want the workspace to be available at /home/ubuntu, you can add the volume path as shown below./home/jenkins is the path inside the container.
```
/home/ubuntu:/home/jenkins
Towards the right of the Volumes option, if you click the question mark, it will show you additional volume options as shown below.
```

![docker jenkins configuration for persistent workspace](images/2.0.10_Docekr_persistent_workspace.jpg)

- Now that you have the slave configurations ready,
- Create a freestyle job, select “Restrict where this project can be run” option and select the docker host as a slave using the label. Add a shell
build step which echoes a simple “Hello World“

![Jenkins configure new item](images/2.0.11_docker-slave-freestyle-job.jpg)


- If you have done all the configurations right, Jenkins will spin up a container, builds the project and destroys the container once the build is done.

- First you will see a pending notification as Jenkins tries to deploy a container on run time and establishes an SSH connection. After a few seconds, your job will start building.
