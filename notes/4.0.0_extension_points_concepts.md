## Extension Points Concepts: 

### Why Jenkins is successful? 

- A major part of the reason for the success of Jenkins and its range of plugins is the design philosophy that was used to develop and extend Jenkins from the beginning. 
  
- This approach to software development has encouraged people to work together, enabled projects to benefit from each other, and created a highly productive and collaborative community of developers and contributors to this project
  
### Before starting plugin development make sure to review this: 

- https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Before+starting+a+new+plugin

### List of exsiting Jenkins plugins

-  https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Plugins
-  https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Extension+points : This list is automatically generated and maintained by the Extension Indexer
   program, which is available at: https://github.com/jenkinsci/backend-extension-indexer . This program parses the current code base for all the declared extension points and then lists them on the Extension points page that it generates, along with further details such as the project home page and a list of the plugins that use them.


  
### Concept for developing new plugin: 

- Interfaces
  
- Abstract Classes

- Singleton

### Declaring an extension in Jenkins

- To define or create an extension in Jenkins, we use the **@Extension** : https://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/?hudson/Extension.html  annotation type.
  
- List of **@ExtensionPoints** available are:  https://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/hudson/ExtensionPoint.html

- **This annotation is picked up by Jenkins, and the new extension will be added to an ExtensionList object, where the extension can then be found via ExtensionFinder.**

- The following example shows the declaration for an Animal extension point: 

```
/**
 * Extension point that defines different kinds of animals
 */
public abstract class Animal implements ExtensionPoint {
  ...

  /**
   * All registered {@link Animal}s.
   */
  public static ExtensionList<Animal> all() {
    return Hudson.getInstance().getExtensionList(Animal.class);
  }
}
```

-  Above example illustrates an abstract class that implements ExtensionPoint:
