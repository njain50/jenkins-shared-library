### Groovy and Gradle as alternatives

- If you are interested in Groovy, you can also use this language and a combination of other tools to create your own pluginsâ€”you don't have to stick
to Java and Maven if you don't want to.

- This page explains how to modify your project to use a build.gradle file in place of the Maven POM file that we used previously:
  http://jenkins-ci.org/content/gradle-fy-your-jenkins-plugin-project

- You can then execute commands such as gradle jpi, gradle check, gradle install, and so on to build and manage the plugin life cycle without Maven.

- This CloudBees presentation illustrates the use of Groovy instead of Java for the plugin itself:
