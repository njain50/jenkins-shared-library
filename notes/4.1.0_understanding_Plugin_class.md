##### The Builder class and the Stapler:

- Understanding src/main/java/io/jenkins/plugins/sample/HelloWorldBuilder.java

1. 
```
public class HelloWorldBuilder extends Builder implements SimpleBuildStep {

```

- As we can see in the JavaDoc at http://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/hudson/tasks/Builder.html, extending the Builder class will register this class with
  Jenkins as a custom builder

2.  
- Also it contains simple method 

```
  @DataBoundConstructor
    public HelloWorldBuilder(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
```

- Through the use of the @DataBoundConstructor annotation, this method will register the selection of this task/build type when the user decides to create this new build type. This is done automatically via the Stapler framework, which Jenkins uses to serialize and convert Java objects.

- You can find out more about Stapler, how it works, and how to make use of it in your plugins here: http://stapler.kohsuke.org/what-is.html

- Next, refer to following class:

```
 @Symbol("greet")
    @Extension
    public static final class DescriptorImpl extends BuildStepDescriptor<Builder> {

        public FormValidation doCheckName(@QueryParameter String value, @QueryParameter boolean useFrench)
                throws IOException, ServletException {
            if (value.length() == 0)
                return FormValidation.error(Messages.HelloWorldBuilder_DescriptorImpl_errors_missingName());
            if (value.length() < 4)
                return FormValidation.warning(Messages.HelloWorldBuilder_DescriptorImpl_warnings_tooShort());
            if (!useFrench && value.matches(".*[éáàç].*")) {
                return FormValidation.warning(Messages.HelloWorldBuilder_DescriptorImpl_warnings_reallyFrench());
            }
            return FormValidation.ok();
        }

```

- above there is an inner class named DescriptorImpl. This extends BuildStepDescriptor, and its function is to provide a way for Jenkins to manage
  instances of GravenBuilder and their lifecycles.


- HelloWorldBuilder class contains all the required installation and registration settings; this sets the tool tips and defines the display name to be
  used for this plugin, and so on.


#### Jelly and Jenkins 

- src/main/resources/io/jenkins/plugins/sample/HelloWorldBuilder/config.jelly

- The config.jelly configuration file is a simple Jelly template. You can find out more about Jelly in Jenkins in the following link:
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Basic+guide+to+Jelly+usage+in+Jenkins

- You can read more about Jelly, in general, here at http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jelly/

- Jelly is a Java and XML based scripting and processing engine.

- The main purpose of Jelly in this context is to provide developers with a highly flexible tag library through which they can quickly and easily create and handle UI view changes.

-  From a developer point of view, Jelly files interact with Java code to get and set declared values at runtime and presents them to the user via the


#### Help

- The help*.html files provide context-sensitive help messages to the user. 
- These messages are simply defined within the <div> tags and will be displayed as standard-looking tooltips within the Jenkins user interface.
- This approach allows you to guide your user, advise them on what they can and can't do, and explain what your plugin does and requires.


### index.jelly 

- The index.jelly file provides the user with a general high-level description of what this plugin does—we will see this text being displayed as the plugin description in Jenkins when we look at the plugin in action later on.


#### Properties files and Messages

- The Messages.properties and config_fr.properties files are there to provide users with i18n internationalization, as described here:
  https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Internationalization

- There is some more detail on localization and internationalization at this link: http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-i18n

-  In Jenkins plugin development, all we really need to do is provide config_LOCALE.properties files to cater to each language. For example, if the user's LOCALE variable is set to fr, the messages in the config_fr.properties file will be used—other LOCALE files can be added as desired to support other languages.

#### POM file

- This one is particular to the plugin we are using here and contains the group, artifact, and version information that will be used to build, run,
  and package the project, which we will do now.

- Right-clicking on the pom.xml file and selecting Run as and then Maven Build… allows you to specify the hpi:run goal again, which should start up a new local instance of Jenkins with this plugin compiled and deployed to this new instance, along with all of the resources and localization settings the plugin contains.
